# Fibonacci 

I tested it on fib<45> on an online compiler; it wouldn't let me use a higher fib due to an overflow. It should go a lot higher on a local compiler though due to unsigned long long.

Runtime speed was 0 or close to 0 seconds. Unfortunately, a friend coded a fib using C that had similar run-time performance. So, this compile-time programming didn't show a significant performance benefit.
